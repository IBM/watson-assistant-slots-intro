# Creating a Pizza ordering Chatbot using Watson Conversation Slots feature


In this developer journey, we will use the Watson Conversation Slots feature to
build a chatbot that takes a pizza order. The needed information such as size, type,
and ingredient choices can all be entered within one Conversation Node, unlike
with previous versions of Conversation.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Create a chatbot dialog with Watson Conversation
* Use the power of Conversation Slots to more efficiently populate data fields
* Use Conversation Slots to handle various inputs within one Node.

# Steps

**NOTE:** Perform steps 1-5 **OR** click the ``Deploy to Bluemix`` button and hit ``Create`` and then jump to step 5.


[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/scottdangelo/watson-conversation-slots-intro #required)


1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Bluemix services](#2-create-bluemix-services)
3. [Get Bluemix credentials and add to .env](#3-get-bluemix-services-credentials-and-add-to-env-file)
4. [Configure Watson Conversation](#4-configure-watson-conversation)
5. [Run the application](#5-run-the-application)

## 1. Clone the repo

Clone `watson-conversation-slots-intro` locally. In a terminal, run:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/ibm/watson-conversation-slots-intro`

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/pizza-advanced.json`](data/pizza-advanced.json) to upload
the Conversation Intents, Entities, and Dialog Nodes.

## 2. Create Bluemix services

Create the following service:

  * [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)

## 3. Get Bluemix Services Credentials and add to .env file

As you create the Blumix Services, you'll need to create service credentials and get the
username and password:


<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="350" src="doc/source/images/WatsonCred1.png">
</p>

Move the watson-conversation-slots-intro/env.sample file to /.env and populate the service
credentials as you create the credentials:

```
# Watson conversation
CONVERSATION_USERNAME=<add_conversation_username>
CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=<add_conversation_password>
WORKSPACE_ID=<add_conversation_workspace>
```

## 4. Configure Watson Conversation

Launch the **Watson Conversation** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="55" src="doc/source/images/import_conversation_workspace.png">
</p>

Find the local version of [`data/pizza-advanced.json`](data/pizza-advanced.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="250" src="doc/source/images/open_conversation_menu.png">
</p>

 Put this Workspace ID into the .env file
as ``WORKSPACE_ID``.

## 5. Run the application

### If you used the Deploy to Bluemix button...

If you used ``Deploy to Bluemix``, most of the setup is automatic, but not
quite all of it. We have to update a few environment variables.

In the Bluemix dashboard find the App that was created. Click on ``Runtime`` on the menu and navigate to the ``Environment variables`` tab.

### If you decided to run the app locally...

```
$ npm start
```

# Conversation Slots Discussion

The power of Slots is in how it reduces the numbe of nodes requiered to implement logic in your Watson Conversation Dialog. Open up the Dialog, and we'll have a look:


![](doc/source/images/pizzaDialogBegin.png)

Each slot represents a field to be populated in the chatbot: ``pizza_size, pizza_type, and pizza_topings``.
If they are not present, the user will be prompted, starting at the top, until all are populated via
the associated variable (``$pizza_size, $pizza_type, etc``).

Click on the Configure ![icon](doc/source/images/pizzaGearIcon.png) to add more funtionality:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaConfig3pizza_toppingsTop.png)

Here, we can add a response for when this slot is filled (Found).
Logic can be used for one ingredient:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaConfig3Pizza_toppingsMid1ingredient.png)

or if there are greater than one ingredient added:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaConfig3Pizza_toppingsMidBotGreater1.png)

We've added logic to address yes or no answers to the question "Any extra toppings?":

![](doc/source/images/pizzaConfig3NewNotFoundconfirm.png)

Click on the 3 circles ![icon](doc/source/images/pizza3circles.png) to edit the json directly:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaConfig3NotFoundJson.png)

Here, we've set an empty value for the context: {"pizza_topings"} field, so that we can exit
the loop by filling this slot.

Finally, we add responses for once the slots are all filled:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaOrderFinish1.png)

We start with the case where we have pizza_topings, by detecting that the
array has size>0.
Here, we first handle the case where the optional "pizza_place" slot
is filled, and then handle the case where it is not.

![](doc/source/images/pizzaOrderFinish2.png)

Finally, we add handlers for the cases where the users answers to a prompt
is not found. We've handlers for the intents "help" and "reset":

![](doc/source/images/pizzaHandleHelp.png)

![](doc/source/images/pizzaHandlerReset.png)

Note that we edit the json directly when we handle the Reset. We'll
set all the fields to null in order to begin again.

# Conversation Example

Let's look at an example conversation and the associated json.
With your Watson Pizzeria running, start a dialog and begin with
telling the Pizza Bot you want a large pizza:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaEX1orderLarge.png)

The 'User Input' shows you the "input"{"text"} field, as well as come of the
"context" that is mostly used for Conversation to keep track of internal state.
Scroll Down to "Watson Understands" and look at "intents":

![](doc/source/images/pizzaEX2WatsonUnderstandsOrderSize.png)

Note that the intent for "order" is detected. The entity "pizza_size" is now
a slot that is filled out.
We still have 2 required slots, pizza_type and pizza_toppings. The user will
be prompted until these are filled out:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaEX3fillSlots.png)

We can now see that all required slots are filled:

![](doc/source/images/pizzaEX4slotsFilled.png)

What if we wanted to tell the Watson Pizzeria that we wanted to
eat the pizza there, in the restaurant? Too late! the slot for
pizza_place is optional, so the user won't be prompted for it, and
once the required slots are filled, we exit the "Pizza Ordering" dialog
node. The user needs to fill out optional slots first.
Type reset to start again and test this by adding the phrase "to eat there...":

* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the setup.py file in the sample application and the ``VCAP_APPLICATION``
and ``VCAP_SERVICES`` environment variables in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This
data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to
measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer
