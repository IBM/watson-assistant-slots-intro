# Run locally

This document shows how to run the `watson-assistant-slots-intro` application on your local machine.

## Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create IBM Cloud services](#2-create-ibm-cloud-services)
3. [Configure Watson Assistant](#3-configure-watson-assistant)
4. [Get IBM Cloud credentials and add to .env](#4-get-ibm-cloud-services-credentials-and-add-to-env-file)
5. [Run the application](#5-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone `watson-conversation-slots-intro` locally. In a terminal, run:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/ibm/watson-conversation-slots-intro`

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/watson-pizzeria.json`](data/watson-pizzeria.json) to upload
the Assistant Intents, Entities, and Dialog Nodes.

### 2. Create IBM Cloud services

Create the following service and name it `wcsi-conversation-service`:

* [**Watson Assistant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/conversation)

### 3. Configure Watson Assistant

#### Import the Assistant workspace.json:

* Find the Assistant service in your IBM Cloud Dashboard.
* Click on the `Manage` tab and then click on `Launch Watson Assistant`.
* Go to the `Skills` tab.
* Click `Create skill`
* Click the `Import skill` tab.
* Click `Choose JSON file`, go to your cloned repo dir, and `Open` the workspace.json file in [`data/watson-pizzeria.json`](data/watson-pizzeria.json).
* Select `Everything` and click `Import`.

To find the `WORKSPACE_ID` for Watson Assistant:

* Go back to the `Skills` tab.
* Find the card for the workspace you would like to use. Look for `WatsonPizzeria`.
* Click on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the card and select `View API Details`.
* Copy the `Workspace ID` GUID.

* In the next step, you will put this `Workspace ID` into the `.env file as ``WORKSPACE_ID``.

### 4. Get IBM Cloud services credentials and add to .env file

* Move the `watson-conversation-slots-intro/env.sample` file to ``watson-conversation-slots-intro/.env``.

* Use the `apikey` from your Watson Assistant service credentials in the `.env` file. Note that older services might still use username/password, so comment those out and use instead, if applicable.

* Put the `Workspace ID` into the `.env file as ``WORKSPACE_ID``.

```bash
WORKSPACE_ID=<put workspace id here>

# Watson Assistant Authentication using IAM
CONVERSATION_IAM_APIKEY=<put assistant IAM apikey here>
CONVERSATION_URL=<put assistant url here>
```

### 5. Run the application

#### If you used the Deploy to IBM Cloud button...

If you used ``Deploy to IBM Cloud``, the setup is automatic.

#### If you decided to run the app locally...

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be available in your browser at http://localhost:3000
